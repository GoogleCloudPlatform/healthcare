For example, the table `mimic_demo.icustays` becomes `mimiciii_clinical.icustays` when you need the actual MIMIC data. One thing to note though, is that it is highly recommended to aggregate data aggressively wherever possible, because large dataframes may cause the performance of colab to drop drastically or even out of memory errors.\n",
