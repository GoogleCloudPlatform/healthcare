        "The inference module is built as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container and deployed using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), allowing you to easily scale your deployment. The dataflow for inference can look as follows (see corresponding diagram below):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Client application uses [STOW-RS](ftp://dicom.nema.org/medical/Dicom/2013/output/chtml/part18/sect_6.6.html) to push a new DICOM instance to the Cloud Healthcare DICOMWeb API.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The insertion of the DICOM instance triggers a [Cloud Pubsub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/) message to be published. The *inference module* will pull incoming Pubsub messages and will recieve a message for the previously inserted DICOM instance. \n",
        "\n",
        "3. The *inference module* will retrieve the instance in JPEG format from the Cloud Healthcare API using [WADO-RS](ftp://dicom.nema.org/medical/Dicom/2013/output/chtml/part18/sect_6.5.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. The *inference module* will send the JPEG bytes to the model hosted on Cloud ML Engine.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Cloud ML Engine will return the prediction back to the  *inference module*.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. The *inference module* will package the prediction into a DICOM instance. This can potentially be a DICOM structured report, [presentation state](ftp://dicom.nema.org/MEDICAL/dicom/2014b/output/chtml/part03/sect_A.33.html), or even burnt text on the image. In this codelab, we will focus on just DICOM structured reports. The structured report is then stored back in the Cloud Healthcare API using STOW-RS.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. The client application can query for (or retrieve) the structured report by using [QIDO-RS](http://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part18/sect_6.7.html) or WADO-RS. Pubsub can also be used by the client application to poll for the newly created DICOM structured report instance.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "To begin, we will create a new DICOM store that will store our inference source (DICOM mammography instance) and results (DICOM structured report). In order to enable Pubsub notifications to be triggered on inserted instances, we will give the DICOM store a Pubsub channel to publish on."
