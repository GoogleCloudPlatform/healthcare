#  AI Platform Notebooks on Cloud Healthcare API

This directory contains AI Platform Notebooks on top of the Cloud Healthcare API. They are intended to be run on AI Platform Notebooks. Follow these instructions to get started.

## Enable AI Platform Notebooks

We first need to enable the AI Platform Notebooks. Follow the steps listed [here](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/notebooks/docs/before-you-begin) to "Enable the APIS".

## Set-up permissions

We need to allow the service account running the AI Platform Notebooks instance to administer Pubsub changes. The codelabs utilize Cloud Pubsub as a notification mechanism. Enter your project ID below and execute the following:

```shell
PROJECT_ID=<YOUR PROJECT_ID>

gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
PROJECT_NUMBER=`gcloud projects describe ${PROJECT_ID} | grep projectNumber | sed 's/[^0-9]//g'`
COMPUTE_ENGINE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT="${PROJECT_NUMBER}-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} --member "serviceAccount:${COMPUTE_ENGINE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT}" --role roles/pubsub.admin
```
## Create AI Platform Notebooks instance

Follow the steps listed [here](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/notebooks/docs/create-new)

## Set-up AI Platform Notebooks instance

In the Jupyter UI, click on the top left to create a new "Notebook" with Python 3.

Then enter the following to import the Git repo containing the ML notebooks/code. This will clone the codelab code to your Datalab environment.

```ipython
!git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/healthcare.git
```

Then, navigate to *datalab/healthcare/imaging/ml_codelab* in a left navigation bar of Jupyter.

Then, click one of the one codelabs (.ipynb files) to begin.
